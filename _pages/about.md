I am a physical oceanographer interested in ocean physics, climate and
modelling. My research focuses on how processes acting on
small-scales, such as turbulent mixing and mesoscale eddies, influence
the large-scale ocean circulation and its variability. I use
theoretical techniques combined with a range of idealized and
realistic ocean models and analysis of oceanographic data to better
understand interactions across scales in the ocean in order to
represent them properly in low-resolution models. I obtained my PhD in
2016 from [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/). I held
several postdoctoral positions at the [University of New South
Wales](http://www.unsw.edu.au) in the [Climate Change Research
Center](https://www.unsw.edu.au/research/ccrc) and the [School of
Mathematics and
Statistics](https://www.unsw.edu.au/science/our-schools/maths) between
2016 and 2021 before joining the [School of
Geosciences](https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/schools/school-of-geosciences.html)
at the [University of Sydney](http://www.sydney.edu.au/) as an ARC
Discovery Early Career Research Award (DECRA) Fellow in late 2021.

## Research Interests

My research interests include:

* **Equatorial dynamics, turbulent mixing and tropical instability
waves:** I am interested in equatorial dynamics and in particular how
processes on short timescales (months to seconds), such as tropical
instability waves (TIWs), internal gravity waves and small-scale
turbulence, influence the large-scale tropical circulation and its
modes of variability such as the El-Nino Southern Oscillation
(ENSO). My PhD work focused on TIWs and their role in driving mixing
in the equatorial Pacific (e.g. their modulation of shear-driven
turbulence, [Holmes and Thomas 2015
J. Phys. Oceanogr.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JPO-D-14-0209.1)). More
recently I have shown that the chaotic nature of TIWs influences ENSO
predictability ([Holmes et al. 2019 Climate
Dynamics](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-018-4217-0)). I have also
been collaborating with scientists at the National Centre for
Atmospheric Research (NCAR, USA) to study variability of turbulent
mixing at the Equator from observations and a hierarchy of
high-resolution models. My recently funded **ARC DECRA** project
*Mixing and air-sea coupling in the Pacific: Toward better El Nino
forecasts* aims to further develop out understanding of air-sea
interactions at the mesoscale in the tropical Pacific and feed that
understanding into improvements in low-resolution models that are used
to provide El Nino forecasts.

* **Ocean heat transport in temperature space:** The ocean is warmed
by air-sea heat fluxes at low-latitudes and warm temperatures and
cooled in the mid- and high-latitudes at colder temperatures. To
maintain a steady state the ocean must therefore move heat not only
from low to high latitudes (*meridional* heat transport), but also
from warm to cold temperatures (*diathermal* heat transport). By
developing a suite of novel heat transport diagnostics within the
MOM5-based Australian community global ocean model
[ACCESS-OM2](http://cosima.org.au/index.php/models/access-om2/), I
study how the ocean's diathermal and meridional heat transport depends
on parameterized diffusive mixing processes ([Holmes et al. 2018
J. Phys. Oceanogr.](https://doi.org/10.1175/JPO-D-18-0098.1), [2019
Geophysical Research
Letters](https://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019GL085160)). This diagnostic
framework allows the role of mixing processes to be isolated and
quantified, including the `artificial' numerical mixing arising from
the numerical discretization of tracer transport [Holmes et al. 2021
J. Adv. Mod. Earth Sys.](https://doi.org/10.1029/2020MS002333).

  heat flows above, below and across the 15C and 20C isotherms from a
  MOM5 global ocean model simulation. Much of the heat that is
  transported northward in the Atlantic is ultimately sourced from
  heat uptake and turbulent mixing in the tropical Pacific (see
  Holmes et al. 2019 Geophysical Research
  Letters for more information).

* **Abyssal ocean circulation and mixing:** I am interested in
diapycnal mixing and how it influences abyssal ocean circulation and
the conversion of Antarctic Bottom Water into lighter water. As mixing
in the abyssal ocean is seafloor-intensified the topography of the
seafloor has a strong influence on abyssal circulation pathways ([de
Lavergne et al. 2017 Nature](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature24472)
and [Holmes et al. 2018
J. Phys. Oceanogr.](https://doi.org/10.1175/JPO-D-17-0141.1)). My more
recent work focuses on using theoretical techniques and idealized
process modelling to understand how tracers are transported in the
abyssal ocean in order to inform future field tracer release
experiments ([Holmes et al. 2019
J. Phys. Oceanogr.](https://doi.org/10.1175/JPO-D-19-0006.1)).

* **Antarctic coastal circulation and ice shelf melting:** I am
involved in a series of projects aimed at understanding the mechanisms
that drive warm Circumpolar Deep Water onto the Antarctic continental
shelf and into contact with vulnerable ice shelves, with worrying
implications for global sea level rise. One such mechanism highlighted
by our work involves the transport of heat onto the continental shelf
by bottom Ekman transport associated with coastally trapped barotropic
waves [Spence, Holmes et al. 2017 Nature Climate
Change](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nclimate3335).
