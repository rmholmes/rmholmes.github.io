I am a physical oceanographer and climate scientist interested in the
physics of the ocean circulation and ocean modelling.  My research
involves applying theoretical techniques and a range of idealized and
realistic ocean models (ROMS, MOM5, MOM6, Dedalus) and analysis of
satellite and in-situ oceanographic data. I am currently a Senior
Research Associate in the [Centre of Excellence for Climate
Extremes](http://climateextremes.org.au/), the [Climate Change
Research Centre](http://www.ccrc.unsw.edu.au/) and the [School of
Mathematics and
Statistics](https://www.maths.unsw.edu.au/about/applied-mathematics)
at the [University of New South Wales](https://www.unsw.edu.au/).

## Research Interests

More information on these projects can be found on the
[projects](/projects/) page.

* _Equatorial Dynamics, Turbulent Mixing and Tropical Instability
Waves:_ I am interested in equatorial dynamics and in particular on
how processes on short timescales (months to seconds), such as
tropical instability waves (TIWs), internal gravity waves and
small-scale turbulence, can influence the seasonal, inter-annual and
decadal variability of the tropical regions.

* _Ocean Heat Transport in Temperature Space_ Using novel diagnostics
in the MOM-SIS and ACCESS-OM2 global ocean models, I have been
studying how the ocean transports heat vertically, meridionally, and
across water-mass boundaries, and how this heat transport is
influenced by diabatic processes in the form of surface forcing and
interior mixing.

* _Abyssal Mixing and the Abyssal Diapycnal Circulation:_ I am
interested in the diapycnal overturning of the abyssal oceans and how
the topography of the seafloor can influence the transformation of
Antarctic Bottom Water into lighter water masses and their ultimate
return to the surface.

* _Antarctic coastal circulation and subsurface warming:_ I am also
involved in work aiming to understand the mechanisms that can bring
warm Circumpolar Deep Water onto the Antarctic continental shelf,
potentially increasing the melt rate of vulnerable ice shelves.

This website contains my CV, publications and talks. I am also in the
process of adding a series of summaries of completed and current
research projects (TBC...). If you wish to know more or have any other
