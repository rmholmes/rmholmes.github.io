I am a physical oceanographer and climate scientist interested in the
physics of the ocean circulation. My research focuses on how processes
acting on small-scales, such as turbulent mixing and mesoscale eddies,
influence the large-scale ocean circulation and its variability. I use
theoretical techniques combined with a range of idealized and
realistic ocean models (regional ROMS, global MOM5, spectral Dedalus)
and analysis of oceanographic data to better understand interactions
across scales in the ocean. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher
in the [Centre of Excellence for Climate
Extremes](http://climateextremes.org.au/), the [Climate Change
Research Centre](http://www.ccrc.unsw.edu.au/) and the [School of
Mathematics and
Statistics](https://www.maths.unsw.edu.au/about/applied-mathematics)
at the [University of New South Wales](https://www.unsw.edu.au/).

## Research Interests

My research interests include:

* _Equatorial dynamics, turbulent mixing and Tropical Instability
Waves:_ I am interested in equatorial dynamics and in particular how
processes on short timescales (months to seconds), such as tropical
instability waves (TIWs), internal gravity waves and small-scale
turbulence, influence the large-scale tropical circulation and its
variability, in particular the El-Nino Southern Oscillation
(ENSO). 

* _Ocean Heat Transport in Temperature Space_ The ocean is warmed by
air-sea heat fluxes at low-latitudes (predominantly in the eastern
Pacific cold tongue, see Fig. 1) and warm temperatures and cooled in
the mid- and high-latitudes at colder temperatures. Therefore, in
order to maintain a steady state, heat must be moved not only from low
to high latitudes (the ocean's *meridional* heat transport), but also
from warm to cold temperatures (the ocean's \textit{diathermal} heat
transport). By developing a suite of novel heat transport diagnostics
within a series of MOM5-based global ocean models (e.g. the Australian
community ocean model,
[ACCESS-OM2](http://cosima.org.au/index.php/models/access-om2/)), I
study how ocean heat transport depends on parameterized diffusive
mixing processes that move heat down-gradient from warm to cold
temperatures. This diagnostic framework allows these important
processes to be isolated and quantified, including the `artificial'
numerical mixing arrising from the discretization of tracer transport
within the models.

* _Abyssal Mixing and the Abyssal Diapycnal Circulation:_ I am
interested in diapycnal mixing and how it influences abyssal ocean
circulation and the transformation of Antarctic Bottom Water into
lighter water masses. As mixing in the abyssal ocean is
seafloor-intensified, the topography of the seafloor has a strong
influence on abyssal circulation pathways and water-mass
transformation ([de Lavergne et al. 2017
Nature](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature24472) and [Holmes et al. 2018
J. Phys. Oceangr.](https://doi.org/10.1175/JPO-D-17-0141.1)). Using
theoretical techniques and idealized process modelling I have also
been studying how tracers are transported in the abyssal ocean in
order to inform planned field tracer release experiments ([Holmes et
al. 2019 J. Phys. Oceangr.](https://doi.org/10.1175/JPO-D-19-0006.1).

* _Antarctic coastal circulation and subsurface warming:_ I am also
involved in a series of projects that aim to understand the mechanisms
through which warm Circumpolar Deep Water penetrates onto the
Antarctic continental shelf, potentially increasing the melt rate of
vulnerable ice shelves with worrying implications for global sea level
rise.
