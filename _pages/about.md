I am a physical oceanographer and climate scientist interested in
ocean physics and modelling. My research focuses on how processes
acting on small-scales, such as turbulent mixing and mesoscale eddies,
influence the large-scale ocean circulation and its variability. I use
theoretical techniques combined with a range of idealized and
realistic ocean models (e.g. the regional model ROMS, the global model
MOM5 and the spectral model Dedalus) and analysis of oceanographic
data to better understand interactions across scales in the ocean. I
obtained my PhD in 2016 from [Stanford
University](https://www.stanford.edu/), working with Professor Leif
Thomas. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the [Centre of
Excellence for Climate Extremes](http://climateextremes.org.au/), the
[Climate Change Research Centre](http://www.ccrc.unsw.edu.au/) and the
[School of Mathematics and
Statistics](https://www.maths.unsw.edu.au/about/applied-mathematics)
at the [University of New South Wales](https://www.unsw.edu.au/) in
Sydney, Australia.

## Research Interests

My research interests include:

* **Equatorial dynamics, turbulent mixing and tropical instability
waves:** I am interested in equatorial dynamics and in particular how
processes on short timescales (months to seconds), such as tropical
instability waves (TIWs), internal gravity waves and small-scale
turbulence, influence the large-scale tropical circulation and its
modes of variability such as the El-Nino Southern Oscillation
(ENSO). My PhD work focused on TIWs and their role in driving mixing
in the equatorial Pacific (e.g. their modulation of shear-driven
turbulence, [Holmes and Thomas 2015
J. Phys. Oceanogr.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JPO-D-14-0209.1)). More
recently I have shown that the chaotic nature of TIWs influences ENSO
predictability ([Holmes et al. 2019 Climate
Dynamics](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-018-4217-0)). I have also
been collaborating with scientists at the National Centre for
Atmospheric Research (NCAR, USA) to study variability of turbulent
mixing at the Equator from observations and a hierarchy of
high-resolution models.

* **Ocean heat transport in temperature space:** The ocean is warmed by
air-sea heat fluxes at low-latitudes and warm temperatures and cooled
in the mid- and high-latitudes at colder temperatures. To maintain a
steady state the ocean must therefore move heat not only from low to
high latitudes (*meridional* heat transport), but also from warm to
cold temperatures (*diathermal* heat transport). By developing a suite
of novel heat transport diagnostics within the MOM5-based Australian
community global ocean model
[ACCESS-OM2](http://cosima.org.au/index.php/models/access-om2/), I
study how the ocean's diathermal and meridional heat transport depends
on parameterized diffusive mixing processes ([Holmes et al. 2018
J. Phys. Oceanogr.](https://doi.org/10.1175/JPO-D-18-0098.1), [2019
Geophysical Research
Letters](https://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019GL085160)). This diagnostic
framework allows the role of mixing processes to be isolated and
quantified, including the `artificial' numerical mixing arising from
the numerical discretization of tracer transport.

that is transported northward in the Atlantic is ultimately sourced
from heat uptake and turbulent mixing in the tropical Pacific (see

Letters](https://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019GL085160)) transport

* **Abyssal ocean circulation and mixing:** I am interested in
diapycnal mixing and how it influences abyssal ocean circulation and
the conversion of Antarctic Bottom Water into lighter water. As mixing
in the abyssal ocean is seafloor-intensified the topography of the
seafloor has a strong influence on abyssal circulation pathways ([de
Lavergne et al. 2017 Nature](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature24472)
and [Holmes et al. 2018
J. Phys. Oceanogr.](https://doi.org/10.1175/JPO-D-17-0141.1)). My more
recent work focuses on using theoretical techniques and idealized
process modelling to understand how tracers are transported in the
abyssal ocean in order to inform future field tracer release
experiments ([Holmes et al. 2019
J. Phys. Oceanogr.](https://doi.org/10.1175/JPO-D-19-0006.1)).

* **Antarctic coastal circulation and ice shelf melting:** I am
involved in a series of projects aimed at understanding the mechanisms
that drive warm Circumpolar Deep Water onto the Antarctic continental
shelf and into contact with vulnerable ice shelves, with worrying
implications for global sea level rise. One such mechanism highlighted
by our work involves the transport of heat onto the continental shelf
by bottom Ekman transport associated with coastally trapped barotropic
waves [Spence, Holmes et al. 2017 Nature Climate
Change](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nclimate3335).
