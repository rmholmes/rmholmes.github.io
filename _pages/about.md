I am a Senior Research Associate in the [Centre of Excellence for
Climate Extremes](http://climateextremes.org.au/), the [Climate Change
Research Centre](http://www.ccrc.unsw.edu.au/) and the [School of
Mathematics and
Statistics](https://www.maths.unsw.edu.au/about/applied-mathematics)
at the [University of New South Wales](https://www.unsw.edu.au/). I
study the physics of ocean circulation using a range of idealized and
realistic ocean models.

## Research Interests

* _Equatorial dynamics and tropical instability waves:_ I am interested
in the physical circulation of the equatorial oceans and how processes
on relatively short timescales (months to seconds), such as tropical
instability waves (TIWs), internal gravity waves and small-scale
turbulence, can influence the seasonal, inter-annual and decadal
variability of the tropical regions. Small-scale vertical and lateral
mixing are important are important factors in the sea surface
temperature and kinetic energy budgets of the large-scale equatorial
circulation and influence how heat and other tracers are transferred
through the surface ocean and stored in the deep ocean. Small-scale
processes in the equatorial oceans also influence phenomena such as
the propagation of equatorial Kelvin waves and coupled modes of
variability such as the El Nino - Southern Oscillation (ENSO).

* _Ocean Heat Transport in Temperature Space_ Using novel diagnostics
in the MOM-SIS and ACCESS-OM2 global ocean models, I have been
studying how the ocean transports heat vertically, meridionally, and
across water-mass boundaries, and how this heat transport is
influenced by diabatic processes in the form of surface forcing and
interior mixing.

* _Abyssal Mixing and the Abyssal Diapycnal Circulation:_ I am
interested in the diapycnal overturning of the abyssal oceans and how
the topography of the seafloor can influence the transformation of
Antarctic Bottom Water into lighter water masses and their ultimate
return to the surface.  Coastal-trapped waves around Antarctic and

I use a range of idealised and realistic ocean models (including ROMS,
MOM5, MOM6 and dedalus) combined with analysis of satellite and
in-situ oceanographic data and theoretical techniques.

(see subpages). If you wish to know more or have any other questions,
