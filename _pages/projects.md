## Ph.D. Projects

The unique dynamics of the equatorial oceans play an important role in
the El Nino - Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the ocean’s meridional
overturning circulation (MOC), both of which are critical processes
that drive global climate variability on a range of time-scales. The
character of ENSO depends on the detailed upper ocean processes that
influence the sea surface temperature (SST) budget and the equatorial
waves that help the upper Pacific ocean to adjust to perturbations in
atmospheric forcing. Inverse models suggest that the abyssal cell of
the MOC is closed through diapycnal upwelling mostly in the tropical
oceans and thus depends on abyssal mixing there that has not been well
observed. My research focuses on understanding equatorial ocean
processes on a range of scales, how they interact and how they
influence large scale climate variability such as the ENSO cycle and
the MOC.

The equatorial oceans are a unique region of the ocean where the
normal 'rules of ocean circulation' do not apply. Large scale
processes (mesoscale and above) in the mid- and high- latitude oceans
are heavily constrained by rotation (through the Coriolis frequency f)
and stratification (through the buoyancy frequency N). These balanced
flows obey the the geostrophic and hydrostatic force balances, and are
approximately 2D. However, at the equator the Coriolis frequency goes
to zero, and thus geostrophic balance can break down.  This change in
dynamics can have important consequences including an enhanced role
for nonlinear and frictional processes at large scales and the unique
character of equatorial internal waves.

My PhD research was centered around both vertical and lateral mixing
at the equator. I worked on a number of projects involving the
dynamics of tropical instability waves (TIWs), vertical and lateral
mixing at the equator, abyssal mixing in the equatorial oceans and
equatorial Kelvin waves.

### Chapter 1: Dynamics of Tropical Instability Vortices

Due to their location near the equator where the Coriolis parameter is
small, submesoscale-like dynamics appear at a larger spatial scale
than in the mid-latitudes. In an article published in the Journal of
Physical Oceanography (Potential Vorticity Dynamics of Tropical
Instability Vortices), I have shown that the formation of TIV core
water shares some similarities with the formation of submesoscale
intrathermocline eddies in the midlatitudes. (see subsection for more
information)

### Chapter 1b: TIW Fronts

Part of the R/V Oceanus research cruise in 2014 that I participated in
(see chapter 4 below) was aimed at studying the dynamics of strong TIW
fronts. These fronts have a large influence on ocean ecosystems and
may also constitute a significant energy loss mechanism for the
TIWs. In collaboration with Sally Warner and Jim Moum at Oregon State
University I investigated these fronts from a modelling pospective,
and compared them to several real fronts observed using ADCP, CTD and
microstructure turbulence instruments on two separate research cruises
in the equatorial Pacific. This work has recently been published in
the [Journal of Physical Oceanography](/publications)

### Chapter 2: The influence of Tropical Instability Waves on Vertical Mixing in the EUC

Recent observations have shown that turbulent mixing within the EUC is
modulated by TIWs, with implications for the role of TIWs in the heat
budget of the upper equatorial Pacific. In an article published in the
Journal of Physical Oceanography (The Modulation of Equatorial
Turbulence by Tropical Instability Waves in a Regional Ocean Model), I
showed that large-scale TIW strain can modulate the shear of the EUC
through horizontal vortex stretching. This modulation of the EUC shear
drives a subsequent modulation of the Richardson number and thus
shear-driven vertical mixing. Furthermore, using a simple 1D mixing
model of the EUC driven by periodic TIW strain, I was able to show
that this modulation drove an overall increase in the turbulent heat
flux, with the amount of increase dependent on the parameterization
for shear-driven vertical mixing included in the mixing model. Thus,
while TIWs are thought to warm the equatorial cold tongue through
lateral mixing, their influence on vertical mixing results in a net
surface cooling that offsets the lateral heating.

### Chapter 3: The Interaction of TIWs and Kelvin waves

For the final part of my PhD I looked at the interaction of TIWs with
equatorial Kelvin waves in an idealized ocean model. This work was
motivated by observations made during the R/V Oceanus research cruise
where an interseasonal Kelvin wave propagating through the eastern
Pacific induced large changes in the intensity of the TIW field. Using
an ensemble set of ROMS simulations we showed that downwelling Kelvin
waves can drive drop of up to 40% in the intensity of TIWs, as
measured with their kinetic energy (TIWKE). In contrast, upwelling
Kelvin waves drove an intensification in TIWKE of a similar
magnitude. These TIWKE changes occured because of Kelvin wave induced
modifications to the background equatorial circulation from which TIWs
gain energy. This work also revealed the importance of wave radiation
in the TIWKE budget. The results of this study were recently published
in the Journal of Physical Oceanography Holmes and Thomas (2016)
Modulation of Tropical Instability Wave Intensity by Equatorial Kelvin
Waves.

### Chapter 4: Abyssal Mixing at the Equator

Inverse models of the meridional overturning circulation (MOC) of the
global ocean suggest that much of the diapycnal mixing required to
sustain the upwelling of deep waters as part of the abyssal cell
occurs in the tropical oceans. However, there are very few direct
measurements of small-scale turbulence in the abyssal equatorial
oceans. In November and December 2014 I participated in a research
cruise aboard the R/V Oceanus organised by Jim Moum from Oregon State
University who's aims included measuring abyssal mixing in the eastern
equatorial Pacific. Our measurements, recently published in
Geophysical Research Letters (Holmes et. al. (2016) Evidence for
Seafloor-Intensified Mixing by Surface-Generated Equatorial Waves),
revealed intense mixing located near the seafloor over a region of
smooth topography near the equator. These measurements are unique
because previously most intense mixing in the deep ocean was thought
to occur only over rough topographic features. Instead, we suggest
that the mixing that we observed was generated by downward propagating
equatorial waves generated at the surface. This constitutes a unique
energy pathway through which wind energy can mix the deep ocean, and
highlights the need for more observations and research work looking at
deep mixing near the equator.
