## Abyssal mixing near the equator: A microstructure turbulence study

In December 2014 I was invited to participate in a five-week research
cruise to the equatorial Pacific by Professor Jim Moum. Jim is a world
leader in making observations of small-scale turbulent mixing using a
number of cutting-edge microstructure turbulence instruments developed
by his group at Oregon State University. The research cruise aboard
the R/V Oceanus (Figure 1) was aimed at measuring turbulence both in
the upper ocean on the equator, but also at testing a new instrument
for making measurements of mixing in the abyssal ocean. The abyssal
measurements were made using a CTD Chi-pod instrument (see Fig. 2)
that measures temperature variability at very high frequency as the
instrument is lowered into the deep ocean.

the top and bottom of the CTD package measure temperature at 100Hz, a
measurement that can be transformed into an estimate of the intensity
of small-scale turbulence.</figcaption>

## Strong abyssal mixing over smooth topography!

Mixing in the abyssal oceans is generally thought to occur mostly
above rough seafloor topography such as seamounts and the mid-ocean
ridges. Here, tidal and geostrophic currents flow over the topography
generating internal waves which break and mix the fluid.  This picture
has been developed over the last several decades through extensive
microstructure turbulence field campaigns. Much of this data was
recently compiled into a single data set by Waterhouse et. al. (2014),
who showed that indeed mixing measurements over rough topography and
mid-ocean ridges showed turbulent mixing intensities, quantified with
the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation epsilon, an order of
magnitude larger than those over smooth topography (compare red, green
and blue curves in Fig. 3).

Our cruise in December 2015 was to a region near the equator where the
seafloor was particularly flat and smooth compared with the global
average. Thus we were surprised to find very energetic mixing, with
energy dissipation rates just as strong as that found elsewhere over
mid-ocean ridges within the bottom 700m of the ocean (compare orange
line with blue line in Fig. 3 below 3200m). What was going on? Was
there something special about the equator?

## Where does the energy come from?

If the energy that drives this mixing is not coming from the seafloor
through flow interactions with rough topography, then it must come
from the surface. One possibility is the downwards radiation of
low-frequency equatorial waves. These waves are commonly found in the
surface equatorial oceans and are generated by wind forcing and
instabilities (such as tropical instability waves). While we did not
have any temporal measurements to investigate the existance of waves
in the deep ocean (each profile of the CTD Chipod represents just one
point in time), we did have a long-time series of velocity
measurements in the upper 800m made by the shipboard ADCP instrument
(Fig. 4). These measurements did indeed show evidence of a
low-frequency wave (upward propagating phases highlighted with black
lines in Fig. 4). In fact, the properties of the measured wave were
consistent with the dispersion relation for a downward propagating
equatorial Yanai wave with downward energy flux ~2mWm-2. This downward
propagating wave had sufficient energy flux to drive the abyssal
mixing estimated from the Chipod instrument to average ~1mWm-2.

propagating phases highlighted in black are consistent with a downward

## Non-traditional wave trapping

The downward propagating equatorial Yanai wave may have sufficient
energy to drive the mixing, but the remaining question is why would it
break and drive mixing in the bottom 700m? Wave breaking typically
occurs at critical layers created by a background mean flow, or where
the vertical wavelength of the wave becomes small in regions of high
stratification. However, we did not observe any mean flows, and the
stratification generally reduces towards the seafloor. One
possibility, normally neglected in most oceanograhic studies, is the
influence of the horizontal component of Earth's rotation (the so
called non-traditional effects). The dispersion relation for a
classical internal waves is,

where omega is the wave frequency, f is the Coriolis parameter, N2 is
the stratification and alpha is the slope of wave
characteristics. Since all terms in this equation are positive, this
implies that a wave can only exist equatorward of where its frequency
omega is equal to f (since f reduces towards the equator). This
results in the wave being trapped within its so-called 'inertial
latitudes' (thick lines in Fig. 5a). However, when the non-traditional
terms are included, the dispersion relation acquires an extra term.


The additional term highlighted in red, dependent on the horizontal
component of Earth's rotation tilde f, can be negative and allows wave
to exist poleward of their inertial latitude in regions where the
stratification is small, i.e. near the seafloor. Practically, this
creates trapping regions near the seafloor where wave energy can enter
but cannot leave, and thus builds up and breaks driving mixing
(compare inverse Richardson number between traditional and
non-traditional cases in Fig. 5). Thus these non-traditional effects
may be responsible for the trapping of the energy of the downward
propagating equatorial Yanai wave, resulting in the bottom-intensified
mixing over smooth topography that we observed with the Chipod.

velocity and the right two panels show inverse Richardson number. The
inverse Richardson number obtains high values in the trapping regions
near the seafloor in the non-traditional solution, suggesting enhanced
mixing there.</figcaption>
