# Equatorially trapped inertia-gravity waves


[![Equatorially trapped IGWs](/files/DedalusEqWaves_frame600.png)](https://vimeo.com/340802059)

The above animation (click on the image for Vimeo link) shows two
simulations of equatorially trapped inertia-gravity waves generated by
a periodic 10-day forcing near the surface. In the left panel the
horizontal component of the Coriolis force is included but in the
right panel it is excluded (the so-called traditional
approximation). Including this component changes the wave physics in
the deep ocean and can create trapping regions where energy builds up
and small scale shear can develop, potentially contributing to deep
ocean mixing. These simulations were performed using the Dedalus
spectral PDEs solver. For more information: [Deep Equatorial Waves
Project Summary](/projects/DeepEqMix), [GRL article: Holmes et
al. (2016): Evidence for Seafloor-Intensified Mixing by
Surface-Generated Equatorial
Waves](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2015GL066472))

The above animation shows SST (top) and vertical velocity at 50m
(bottom) from a 1/20-degree ROMS simulation of the eastern equatorial
Pacific. This simulation was performed in collaboration with Daniel
Whitt at NCAR as part of a project to investigate the dynamics of
mixing and upwelling in the Pacific cold tongue.

# Tracer transport in Abyssal Mixing Layers

</p>

The above animation shows a tracer released near a sloping boundary
within an idealized abyssal mixing layer. The tracer spreads
vertically due to bottom-intensified vertical diffusion and up the
slope within a thin Bottom Boundary Layer (BBL) where the buoyancy
flux converges and drives diapycnal upwelling. The rate of increase of
the variance of the tracer in density space (left panel) reduces once
the tracer encounters the boundary. For more information: [JPO
