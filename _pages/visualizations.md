# Equatorially trapped inertia-gravity waves

The below animation shows two simulations of equatorially trapped
inertia-gravity waves generated by a periodic 10-day forcing near the
surface. In the left panel the horizontal component of the Coriolis
force is included but in the right panel it is excluded (the so-called
traditional approximation). Including this component changes the wave
physics in the deep ocean and can create trapping regions where energy
builds up and small scale shear can develop, potentially contributing
to deep ocean mixing. These simulations were performed using the
Dedalus spectral PDEs solver.
