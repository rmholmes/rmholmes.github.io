# Equatorially trapped inertia-gravity waves

The below animation (click on the image for Vimeo link) shows two
simulations of equatorially trapped inertia-gravity waves generated by
a periodic 10-day forcing near the surface. In the left panel the
horizontal component of the Coriolis force is included but in the
right panel it is excluded (the so-called traditional
approximation). Including this component changes the wave physics in
the deep ocean and can create trapping regions where energy builds up
and small scale shear can develop, potentially contributing to deep
ocean mixing. These simulations were performed using the Dedalus
spectral PDEs solver.

# Tropical Instability Waves

The below animation shows SST (top) and vertical velocity at 50m
(bottom) from a 1/20-degree ROMS simulation of the eastern equatorial
Pacific. This simulation was performed incollaboration with Dan Whitt
at NCAR as part of a project to investigate the dynamics of mixing and
upwelling in the Pacific cold tongue.
